Filter only cases where hh interview = 1, create a variable `hhweightHH48` by multiplying 
`HH48` and `hhweight`, number of hh members by sample weight

```{r}

hh <- hh %>% filter(HH46 == 1) %>%
  mutate(hhweightHH48 = HH48 * hhweight,
         nhhmem = 1)

hh <- hh %>%

  mutate(WS1 = ifelse(WS1 == 71, "Cart with small tank", WS1)) %>% 
  mutate(WS1 = ifelse(WS1 == 91, "Bottled water [A]", WS1)) %>%
