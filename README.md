# Project Page - MICS R Consulting


Github page for the MICS R analysis project. All files / work can still be transferred to OneDrive or vice a versa, but some benefits to using this repository are: 

* Central code repo with full transparency and controlled access (repo is private)
* Transparency - easily track productivity with every code upload visible 
* Version Controlled 
* Primary platform for all engineering / software collaboration 
* Easy collaboration, smooth transition into e.g. "UNICEF MICS R Package" etc.
